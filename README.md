#Geostrategic Country Simulator

Choose your country and play!

Map with all first-level Administrative Divisions (mapchart). Every province is loaded as a SVGPath in JavaFX.

WorldMap -> the map of the world.

GLogic -> the main game logic class which relates all other classes which have saving/loading functionality (through serialization)

GameStage makes the interaction between the two possible and has the UI necessary for gameplay.
